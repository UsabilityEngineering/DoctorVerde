# Phase I: Requirements Gathering

* __Executive Summary:__ Looked into finding common issues among plant growers, from farmers to home gardeners with the desire to use technology to automate detection of these issues to allow for quick remedies.
  * Issues include plant illness, pests, etc.
  * Looking into all plants, from fruit trees to rose bushes.
  * Will create a technology that is **learnable**, **efficient**, and **effective**.  
* **Data Gathered:** **Interviews** of plant owners (n = 4) to obtain relevant information about the number of plants owned, money spent on them, **Studied documentation** of how to properly raise plants.
  * Used resources such as the web, libraries, and plant shops to learn as much as possible. 
* __Outcomes:__ Most plant owners mostly had issues with doing too much to their plants.
  * This includes overwatering, overtrimming, etc.
  * Only one interviewee dealt with mildew killing their plant.
  * Interviewed home plant owners **resort to Google**, the instructions that came with the plant, or the plant shop for advice when growing their plant.
    * **75%** resorted to Google first for help with their plant
  * Not much information was gathered in regards to common illnesses and reasons for getting to that point, due to **most interviewees being home plant owners.**

# Phase II: User-Centered Design

## Executive Summary: 
This design is what we decided is best for our users, inspired by the common issues that most of our interviewees dealt with while growing their plants. We started with a sketch of the design. Most of our interviewees wanted something that would work camera-based, as they are used to taking pictures for their families. They would be most comfortable with using a mobile application that feels familiar. Through iterative design, we improved on the sketch. We made sure that our design is error-tolerant, which is quite important for our audience. After this, we created a wireframe that contained all the menu options and basic design. We thought of how the interactions would go, and we settled with a prototype that was easily learnable.
