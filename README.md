# Phase I: Requirements Gathering

* __Executive Summary:__ 
  * Looked into finding common issues among plant growers, from farmers to home gardeners with the desire to use technology to automate detection of these issues to allow for    quick remedies.
  * Issues include plant illness, pests, etc.
  * Looking into all plants, from fruit trees to rose bushes.
  * Will create a technology that is **learnable**, **efficient**, and **effective**.
  * Interviewed plant owners for information

# Phase II: User-Centered Design

* __Executive Summary:__
  * Analyzed data gathered from Phase I to influence app direction and design
  * Created low-fidelity sketches of our ideal application
  * Iteratively improved app design until the team approved
  * Created wireframes and ensured smooth flow and simplicity of app
  * Turned wireframes into higher fidelity interactive prototype
