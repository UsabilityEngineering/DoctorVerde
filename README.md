# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

* __Executive Summary:__ Looked into finding common issues among plant growers, from farmers to home gardeners with the desire to use technology to automate detection of these issues to allow for quick remedies.
  * Issues include plant illness, pests, etc.
  * Looking into all plants, from fruit trees to rose bushes.
  * Will create a technology that is **learnable**, **efficient**, and **effective**.  
* **Data Gathered:** **Interviews** of plant owners (n = 4) to obtain relevant information about the number of plants owned, money spent on them, **Studied documentation** of how to properly raise plants.
  * Used resources such as the web, libraries, and plant shops to learn as much as possible. 
* __Outcomes:__ Most plant owners mostly had issues with doing too much to their plants.
  * This includes overwatering, overtrimming, etc.
  * Only one interviewee dealt with mildew killing their plant.
  * Interviewed home plant owners **resort to Google**, the instructions that came with the plant, or the plant shop for advice when growing their plant.
    * **75%** resorted to Google first for help with their plant
  * Not much information was gathered in regards to common illnesses and reasons for getting to that point, due to **most interviewees being home plant owners.**
