## Protocol Overview

### Background
The purpose of the background questions is to determine if the user has used websites or utilities/applications to seek information or advice about plants in the past. 

### Task 1

### Task 2

### Wrap-up

### Overall Approach
We used the think-aloud approach, since we know hearing the user's thought process is the simplest way to find out what they are thinking. We do not risk getting any false presumptions about what they are thinking this way. This will help us avoid changing our design to something the users dont want. It is also cheap to do, convincing, and easy to conduct. Knowing what the user thinks will guide us into making a mobile software that will suit the users as well as possible, and is easy to integrate into their daily lifes as quickly as possible.
