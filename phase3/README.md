## Protocol Overview

### Background
The purpose of the background questions is to determine if the user has used websites or utilities/applications to seek information or advice about plants in the past. If they have, we ask what sort of questions they searched in order to help us improve our application and include information users commonly seek. We then ask if the past websites/uilities they used were lacking features they believe would be useful.

### Task 1
This task presents the user with the scenario of being gifted a plant they know nothing about and seeing how they use the application to figure out how to take proper care of it. The user can either scan the plant or search through the app's plant database. We then have the user rate the difficulty of the task given in order to acess our app's usability in this situation.

### Task 2
This task presents the user with the scenario of owning a plant for years that is now suddenly looking ill despite no changes in care. Again, the user can either scan the plant to detect the issue or they can look through the app's database to try to get an idea of what is afflicting their plant. We then have the user rate the difficulty of the task given in order to acess our app's usability in this situation.

### Wrap-up
In the final section of the usability test, we have the user tell us their favorite and least favorite aspects of the application. We then ask them to tell us if there are any features they feel are missing or would prove useful. We then ask the user how they feel about each crucial part of the application: the scan a plant option, the usefulness of the information given by the scan results, and the databse the users can search for various plant issues and ilnesses manually. We then allow for final comments and conclude the usability test.

## Overall Approach
We used the think-aloud approach, since we know hearing the user's thought process is the simplest way to find out what they are thinking. We do not risk getting any false presumptions about what they are thinking this way. This will help us avoid changing our design to something the users dont want. It is also cheap to do, convincing, and easy to conduct. Knowing what the user thinks will guide us into making a mobile software that will suit the users as well as possible, and is easy to integrate into their daily lifes as quickly as possible.
