# Doctor Verde, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Methods

**1. Interviews**

**Why:** 
Some plant owners do not use technology and would not answer surveys. We could get to know common problems, and the common techniques the plant owners employ to take care of them. We will be able to find out where they go to find out more about taking care of their plants, giving us relevant information.
Number of users (n = 4)

**2. Studying Documentation**

**Why:** 
We want to find out more about the topic we are trying to fix. We do not know much about plants and we need to understand our problem space more and solutions that are already available.
Number of users (n = N/A)

## Findings

Findings were collected via individual interviews from a small number of college aged participants.


## Conclusions



## Caveats

**Interviews:** Out of the pool of people we had an opportunity to interview, we were only able to interview 4 people, severely limiting the data we could gather and limiting the variety of demographics of interviewees. Sadly, we were unable to interview any farmers or botanists, only entry level plant owners.

**Documentation:** Researching plant documentation provides us with useful information on plant care and common illnesses, but it lacks anecdotal analysis and is more scientific. We donâ€™t get to hear opinions from various demographics the same way we would through interviews or observations.
