# Doctor Verde, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

* **Data Gathered:** **Interviews** of plant owners (n = 4) to obtain relevant information about the number of plants owned, money spent on them, **Studied documentation** of how to properly raise plants.
  * Used resources such as the web, libraries, and plant shops to learn as much as possible. 
* __Outcomes:__ Most plant owners mostly had issues with doing too much to their plants.
  * This includes overwatering, overtrimming, etc.
  * Only one interviewee dealt with mildew killing their plant.
  * Interviewed home plant owners **resort to Google**, the instructions that came with the plant, or the plant shop for advice when growing their plant.
    * **75%** resorted to Google first for help with their plant
  * Not much information was gathered in regards to common illnesses and reasons for getting to that point, due to **most interviewees being home plant owners.**

## Methods

**1. Interviews**

**Why:** 
Some plant owners do not use technology and would not answer surveys. We could get to know common problems, and the common techniques the plant owners employ to take care of them. We will be able to find out where they go to find out more about taking care of their plants, giving us relevant information.
Number of users (n = 4)

**2. Studying Documentation**

**Why:** 
We want to find out more about the topic we are trying to fix. We do not know much about plants and we need to understand our problem space more and solutions that are already available.
Number of users (n = N/A)

## Findings

Findings were collected via individual interviews from a small number of college aged participants. From those interviews we gained useful information about how people deal with their plant problems. Of the people we interviewed, **75%** of them used Google to find information, when dealing with a sick plant. Though it was noted that the **information they receive online was typically not that helpful.** We also found a correlation between age & amount of plants owned. People who were **older & better off financially** were **more likely to have plants** & therefore spend more on them. 

## Conclusions

The biggest takeaway from our interviews would be that **most people own a small number of plants**, which they **spend a nominal amount of money on** within a given year. Of the people we interviewed, most used Google as their primary resource of plant information. Though most found it **difficult to find useful information** pertaining to there exact problem. However, we **noticed** that **as a person gets older they tend to spend more on plants & maintaining their health**. We believe that our product could prove **useful to homeowners**, who spend a good amount of money maintaining the health of their plants.

## Caveats

**Interviews:** Out of the pool of people we had an opportunity to interview, we were only able to interview 4 people, severely limiting the data we could gather and limiting the variety of demographics of interviewees. Sadly, we were unable to interview any farmers or botanists, only entry level plant owners.

**Documentation:** Researching plant documentation provides us with useful information on plant care and common illnesses, but it lacks anecdotal analysis and is more scientific. We donâ€™t get to hear opinions from various demographics the same way we would through interviews or observations.
