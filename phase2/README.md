| Login | Sign Up | Home Page |
| Here is where the user can login or create an account with us to allow us to keep track of their previous scans. | This is where the user will be taken if they have not used this app before, and need to create an account. | The user can select what feature to use from the app at this point. They can perform an analysis of a plant by scanning it for issues, check their previous scans, or they can find a quick lookup on common illnesses that a plant may have. |

| Plant Scan | Plant Scan Confirmation | Plant Scan Results |
| This is the heart of the program, and is inspired by our interviewees mentioning that they wish they would quickly be able to look up what the problem is without having any prior knowledge of plant care. This is where the user can take a picture of the plant they want to diagnose. We will use the phone's camera to scan the image, and use advanced algorithms to detect any patterns that resemble an illness or issue with the plant. | This was recommended to be added during class critique, just in case the user made mistakes while taking a picture of their plant. This is where the user can confirm if the picture taken looks good enough to be used for the scan or if they need to retake the picture. | Here is where the results of the plant scan are displayed. This will describe the issue/illness that the plant may have, what can cause the issue, and some potential remedies for the plant. |

| Previous Scans | Previous Scan Report | Common Illnesses | 
| Here is where the user can view all of their previous scan reports which are sorted by date and include a thumbnail to help a user identify which scan is which in case a user needs to look back on previous scans. This feature is why making an account is necessary to use the app, as we must store the user's data and link it to an account. | This screen shows the report of a previous scan after being selected from the previous scans menu and displays the information on the plant as if the scan was just performed. | Many of our interviewees are dealing with similar issues, so we decided to aggregate this data here. This list shows common issues/illnesses that the plant owners deal with frequently and we include it in hopes that this can help a user quickly identify and solve the issue without having to do extra scans or research. |

| Common Illness Description | Profile / Settings | 
| Here is what we view if we select one of the options in the common illnesses menu. This page simply gives a description of the issue/illness and provides infromation on causes and potential treatments. | Here is where the user can change their account information, turn on dark mode, delete their account, or logout. |
